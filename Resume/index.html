            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>One of  experiences is when i was in SCLA during the program our task was being able to create a app that will help our community. Me and my team were a group of three and we had to come up with a problem statement under our time limit which was a month, our team was able to complete the task by coming up with a problem statment and a MVP in under a month. I am able to work with a short group and be able to complete our tasks with a time limit.  </p>
            <p>Another of my experiences is learning how to adapt to new people and their ways of thinking. Ive worked with many people but when it comes to somone new and their way of thinking and learning is different thant other peoples ways,  I study how they learn and how they think so i am able to understand who they work. I take a minute to procces it and i mimic their ways of thinking and as i am doing that im also getting to know them so i can be on the same page with them.     </p>

            <h3>Skill</h3>
            <p>One of the skills i have developed is patients. Sometimes you dont get the results you expect to get and get frusterated for not getting the results you want to see. Ive developed this skill by going fishing the reason as of how i devopled it is because when you go fishing theres times where you want to catch something but you dont catch anything. You may have one of the best rods, reels, best spot, or best baits but sometimes you dont catch anything and youll get frusterated to the point where you want to give up because you havent caught anything in 2 hours. Thats were patients comes in you cant rush fishes to take the bait you have to wait till they take it, you can be in a spot for hours and still not catch anything but that sparks an idea there on what new tackticks, bait, or spot you should go to so youll be able to catch something. </p>
            <p>Another skill i have developed is being understand a teammate or a friend. When a teammate or a friend is in need of help i do everything possible to help them out, I tend to put myself in thier shoes and think of what would i do in thier situation. I would keep trying and trying to help them out in any way possible I wont stop till i know they are ok.  </p>
